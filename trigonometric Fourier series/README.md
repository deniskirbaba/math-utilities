## Plotting trigonometric Fourier series ##

For a function given on a segment, construct three Fourier series: 
* a general trigonometric series; 
* a Fourier series in sines;
* a Fourier series in cosines.

For each obtained series: 
* build (using a computer) graphs of several partial sums (for example, S<sub>5</sub>, S<sub>10</sub>, S<sub>50</sub>) and the graph of the original function. Verify (visually) that the partial sums approximate the original function. 
* Write the sum of the Fourier series.
